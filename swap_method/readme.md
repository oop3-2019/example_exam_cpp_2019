# Swap Method

Implement the swap method in the `MathHelper` class so that the `reverse()` method of the `NumberList` works as it should. You may change the signature of the `swap()` method if needed.

The `swap()` method should swap the content of the `left` and `right` arguments.

Dot not forget to uncomment the implementation of `reverse()` method of the `NumberList`.
